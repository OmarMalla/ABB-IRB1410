# ABB-IRB1410-DH
An accurate simplified model for ABB IRB1410.
The model uses the DH Apporach based on a simplified yet accurate model and is compared to the actual robot's model in ABB's Robot Studio.

Created as part of:
*Malla, O. and Shanmugavel, M. (2024), "Simplified model to study the kinematics of manipulators with parallelogram linkages", Industrial Robot, Vol. 51 No. 5, pp. 704-714. https://doi.org/10.1108/IR-01-2024-0046*

The code requires the use of Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox for Matlab:
